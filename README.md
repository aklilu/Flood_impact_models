# Impact data analysis Uganda:  

For my internship assignment, I helped 510 with making a statistical model that could predict the impact of floods in Uganda (part of the Impact Based Forecasting process). 

By explaining my R-code, I will explain all the steps I have taken to master this project (every paragraph in the read me file refers to a paragraph in my R-code). Also I will explain why I have made certain decisions, the results, and some recommendations of steps that have to be undertaken to improve upon the predictions.
