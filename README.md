# Impact data analysis Uganda:  

This project is based on creating a statistical model that is able to predict the impact of future floods in Uganda (part of the Impact Based Forecasting process). 

In this readme file, I will discuss the following: 
1. Research question 
2. Required datasets
3. Explanation R-script 
	- Load in rainfall dataset
	- Load in desinventar dataset 
	- Load in CRA dataset 
	- Prepare rainfall dataset for merging 
	- Prepare desinventar dataset for merging 
	- Prepare CRA dataset for merging 
	- Merge the three datasets 
	- Aggregate floods
	- Rename and define variables
	- Prepare dataset
	- Examine dataset 
	- Lasso logistic regression 
	- Support vector machine (with radial basis kernel)
	- Random forest 
	- Stepwise logistic regression
