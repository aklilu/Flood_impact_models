# Start-up: 

Download the Github files in the folder C:\Users\*Username*\Documents\GitHub\statistical_floodimpact_uganda. This is by default the directory were the files will be downloaded in. 

Open the R-code you want to run and make sure that your working directory is set correct. You can do this by running the following line:  

```
setwd("~/GitHub/statistical_floodimpact_uganda")
```
 
You can run the entire code now. Good luck!
